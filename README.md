# Anthropic entity extraction recipe
To complete the entity extraction recipe in the cookbook, first complete the [Anthropic quick start guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/quickstart-guide)

Specifically, you'll need the following to complete the recipe:
1. A valid Anthropic API key, created on your [developer console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. The Anthropic Python SDK, `anthropic` installed into your environment

If you want to jump into the recipe to explore entity extraction without having to install Python or configure an environment on your local computer, click the "Open in Colab" button above. It will launch this recipe in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) so you can get started in just a few seconds without downloading a thing!

**Note:** Opening in Google Colab opens the notebook, but it does not copy over the `voicemails.txt` file into the environment. If I had more time I would have found a seamless way to open this repo in Colab without having to ask the user to download the file, and then upload to Colab.
