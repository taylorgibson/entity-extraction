    "To extract the information from our voicemail transcripts, define the `extract_entities` function which contains a prompt specific to this application to Claude. You should consider the following aspects of the prompt that you may want to change:\n",
    "* **JSON output:** This prompt specifically asks for entities to be structured as JSON output, and prefills the Assistant message with `{` to guide the output in this direction. Consider if JSON is the most appropriate output for your project. For additional information on using different output formats, see [prefilling](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/prefill-claudes-response) and [control output format](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/control-output-format).\n",

Other options may be more appropriate for your use case. [Learn more about how Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku compare](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview#model-comparison).\n",

This flexible generic prompt can effectively be adapted for different uses cases, however it does has some limitations.

    "* **Acknowledge limitations:** I also would have liked to show some of the limitations of this generic prompt, and how to overcome them with stronger prompting techniques.\n",
    "* **Utilize advanced Claude features:** Lastly, I would have loved to showcase how you can use the [tool use feature of Claude to force a JSON output](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use-examples#json-mode) as an extra section of the recipe. This additional complexity would have been a nice extension for more experienced users."
